    "\n",
    "The Bell states are a set of four maximally entangled states for a two-qubit system. Broadly speaking, a system is maximally entangled if you can measure just one qubit and gain complete information about the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bell States are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ket{\\Phi^+} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{00} + \\ket{11})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ket{\\Phi^-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{00} - \\ket{11})$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\ket{\\Psi^-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{01} - \\ket{10})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why these states are maximally entangled, let us examine the $\\ket{\\Phi^+}$ state in particular. In this state, the only possible outcomes are $\\ket{00}$ and $\\ket{11}$, meaning the two qubits always yield the same measured outcome. Therefore, if you measure one qubit to be $0$, you immediately know the other qubit must be $0$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, try to produce the $\\ket{\\Phi^+}$ Bell state in a two-qubit system using the gates we have learned about.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: In order to produce an entangled state, you must use a two-qubit gate (such as CX). You should place one qubit into a 50-50 superposition and use another gate that ensure that the two qubits will always yield the same outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Initialize your two-qubit system\n",
    "- Use a gate to place $q_0$ into a 50-50 superposition\n",

This means that a measurement on any qubit in the entire system reveals information about every single qubit in the system and collapses them all simultaneously. It is similar to the $\\ket{\\Phi^+}$ state in that every qubit will always measure the same value. Therefore, you should use your implementation in Problem 2 as inspiration. For this problem, keep your system as general as possible and produce a GHZ state for an arbitrary system size.\n",
